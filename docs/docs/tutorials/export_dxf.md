# Exporting to .DFX Files

To support exchange with AutoCAD, MeasureIt_ARCH includes an option to render view out as .dxf files.

!!! Warning
    .dxf export is very much a work in progress and will never be perfect. This exporter is meant to be "good enough" to facilitate basic exchange of drawings from MeasureIt_ARCH to AutoCAD.
    
    Until Autodesk decides to meaningfully impliment open exchange formats and well documented standards, propper interoperability is difficult to achieve...
