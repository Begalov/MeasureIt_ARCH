# Text Fields

Anything in MeasureIt_ARCH that displays text (Dimensions, Annotations etc.) uses Text Fields. At their simplest Textfields display user authored text, or measurements generated by the add-on, but Text Fields also have a variety of auto fill options.

## Where to find Text Fields

The Text Field UI can be found below the List menus for Annotations, Dimensions and Views. It displays the text fields associated with the activly selected item in the list.

## Text Field UI

The Text Field UI has the following options:

* __Add Text Field:__ Adds a Text Field
* __Remove Text Field:__ Removes the last Text Field in the list

For each text field available, the following properties will be displayed:

* __![image](../icons/bi__autofill.png) AutoFill:__ Enables or disables AutoFill
* __Text:__ User authored text for this Text Field
* __Move Up:__ Moves this Text Field up the list
* __Move Down:__ Moves this Text Field down the list

## ![image](../icons/bi__autofill.png)  Auto Fill Sources

If AutoFill is selected enabled, then a dropdown of autofill sources will become available. Autofill can automaticall populate text from the folowing sources:

!!! Note
    AutoFill is particularly usefull for setting up Titleblocks. Check out the [Titleblock Tutorial](../tutorials/titleblock_setup.md) for an example

!!! Warning
    Not all AutoFill sources work in all text field contexts, we're working on a way to hide sources in the dropdown that won't work in that context, but for now, the suitable contexts are noted in each sources description below.

### ![image](../icons/bi__text_file.png) Text File:

The Text File source allows you to fill the text field from any plain text files loaded in Blender. Text files can be created in [Blender's Text Editor](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/text_editor.html) or loaded from an external .txt file using the "Text" -> "Open" menu in the Text Editor.

This is particularly usefull for longer text that requires multiple lines, like specifications or general notes.

### ![image](../icons/bi__custom_prop.png) Custom Property:

The Custom Property Autofill option allows you to fill the text field from any property of the object this text field is associate with, using Blender's scripting API. Enter the data path of the property you want to access in the textbox next to the dropdown.

A common use for this is accessing the Blender's [Custom Object Propeties](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/3.0/files/data_blocks.html#files-data-blocks-custom-properties). For example, if I added a "Manufacturer" Property to an object then I could auto fill the value of that property by entering `[Manufacturer]` as the data path.

Other example include:

- `[<Property Name]` would autofill the value of the custom property with matching `<Property Name>`
- `.name` would autofill the name of the object
- `.location[0]` would autofill the X location of the object
- `.material_slots[0].name` would autofill the name of the first material on the object

### ![image](../icons/bi__curve.png) Curve Lenth:

    This will likely be removed when we add a Curve Dimension type.
