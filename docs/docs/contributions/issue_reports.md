# Reporting Issues & Bugs

MeasureIt_ARCH is a work in progress, developed mostly by one person, in their spare time. There will be bugs. If you, dear user, are lucky enough to find one of these bugs, please report it so I can attempt to fix it. 

This guide will tell you what to report, where to report it, and what information you should include when reporting.

## What is an Issue / Bug that I should Report?

For MeasureIt_ARCH I consider all of the following to be bugs that should be reported:

- Blender Crashes when using MeasureIt_ARCH
- Blender Reports an Error in the [Info Editor](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/info_editor.html) when using MeasureIt_ARCH
- A MeasureIt_ARCH tool produces an unexpected or unintutive result (*that isn't clearly described in the docs*) 

    !!! Example
        - an Area Dimension Text isn't centered properly,
        - the Add Dimension Button occaisionally produces a duplicate Dimension

- A MeasureIt_ARCH property behaves in an unexpected way
- You can't find a feature or property where it is described in the docs
- A feature or property isn't documented

Essentially if there's anything that makes you think **_"huh thats not what I expected would happen"_** then I'd like to hear about it.

Anything that make you think **_'I really wish it did <Somthing new\>'_** is a feature request, and I'd like to hear those too, but check out the "Requesting Features" page for Feature Request Guidelines. 

## Where to Report Issues

Issues should be reported in the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/kevancress/MeasureIt_ARCH/issues).

!!! Warning
    MeasureIt_ARCH does have a [Youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/c/MeasureItARCH) and a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/measureit_arch), but the GitHub issue tracker is the only source that I regularly check when working on Issues. If you report an issue to my youtube or twitter account it will likely be lost and forgotten.
